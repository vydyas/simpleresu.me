Your resume is often the first impression you make on potential employers. Avoid these common mistakes to ensure your resume gets noticed for the right reasons.

## 1. Typos and Grammatical Errors

Nothing screams "unprofessional" like spelling mistakes. Always:
- Proofread multiple times
- Use spell check
- Ask a friend to review
- Read it aloud to catch errors

## 2. Using an Outdated Format

Resumes from 2010 won't cut it in 2024. Modern resumes should:
- Be clean and scannable
- Use modern fonts and layouts
- Be optimized for ATS systems
- Include relevant sections

## 3. Being Too Vague

Generic statements don't help. Instead of "worked on projects," say:
- "Developed a React application that increased user engagement by 30%"
- "Managed a team of 5 developers to deliver 3 major features"
- "Reduced server costs by 25% through optimization"

## 4. Including Irrelevant Information

Keep it relevant:
- Remove outdated skills
- Focus on recent experience
- Tailor content to the job
- Remove personal information (age, marital status, etc.)

## 5. Poor Contact Information

Make it easy to reach you:
- Use a professional email
- Include your LinkedIn profile
- Add your portfolio or GitHub
- Ensure your phone number is current

## Quick Checklist

Before submitting your resume, ensure:
- ✅ No spelling or grammar errors
- ✅ Modern, clean format
- ✅ Specific, quantified achievements
- ✅ Relevant information only
- ✅ Complete contact information
- ✅ Properly formatted for ATS

## Conclusion

Avoiding these common mistakes will significantly improve your chances of landing interviews. Take the time to create a polished, professional resume that accurately represents your skills and experience.
